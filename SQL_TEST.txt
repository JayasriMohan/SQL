What are the differences between local and global temporary tables?
       --A table consist of rows and columns,Local table can be accessed within the database 
whereas global table can be accessed from anywhere or outside from other data bases too.


What is CHECK constraint?
       -- Check constarint query is used in SQL in order to check the condition or making constraint 
keys.which are included primary key,foreign key and etc..



What is a Trigger?
       --Trigger is such a thing which is used in SQL to simply block the operation of dml and ddl in dbms
like insert, update,delete .if a table or a database or a server has been triggered then there is no 
chance to use ddl or dml in that particular table or a database or a server operation untill otherwise 
the trigger has disabled



What is an IDENTITY column in insert statements?
        --An identity column is used in insert statement which will provide a automatic increasing value for
the given number of limit
ex:create table workers(worker_id int primary key identity(1,1)



What is the difference between COMMIT and ROLLBACK?
        -- Commit permits the user to do certain task or action whereas Rollback will undo the operation
which is already performed by the commit statement

        -- Join is a technique used in SQL to connect more than one table in a databse.There are several
types of join available in sql
They are:
        Inner join
        Outer join
        Full join
        Right join
        Left join



How can you relate a Foreign Key and a Primary Key?
        --It is possible relate a foreign key and a primary key using references key word
ex:FOREIGN KEY (WORKER_REF_ID) REFERENCES Worker(WORKER_ID)



What is the difference between Stored Procedures and Functions?
        --Functions are having certain task itself and it has parameters to pass the values through that,
it has to be called each and every time whenever needed.Whereas a storedprocedure are pre-compiled functions
which are stored in the database .stored functions are more faster than the functions.because they are pre_complied .



What do you mean by Clustered Indexes?
        --Clusterd index means the physical order of data.A table can contain only one clusterd index ,clustered index
will automatically created when the table has a primary key.If a table doesn't has a primary key then the clustered 
index should be created manually
